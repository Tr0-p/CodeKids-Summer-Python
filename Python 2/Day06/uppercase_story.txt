ONCE UPON A TIME THREE LITTLE PIGS SET OUT TO BUILD THEIR OWN HOMES
THE FIRST PIG BUILT HIS HOUSE OUT OF STRAW BECAUSE IT WAS THE EASIEST MATERIAL TO WORK WITH
THE SECOND PIG A BIT MORE CAUTIOUS CHOSE STICKS THINKING THEY WOULD PROVIDE BETTER PROTECTION
THE THIRD PIG THE WISEST OF ALL BUILT HIS HOUSE WITH BRICKS KNOWING IT WOULD BE THE STRONGEST
ONE DAY A HUNGRY WOLF CAME BY AND SAW THE PIGS 
HE APPROACHED THE STRAW HOUSE AND DEMANDED TO BE LET IN
WHEN THE FIRST PIG REFUSED THE WOLF HUFFED AND PUFFED AND BLEW THE HOUSE DOWN
THE FRIGHTENED PIG RAN TO HIS BROTHER'S STICK HOUSE
THE WOLF FOLLOWED AND REPEATED HIS DEMAND AT THE STICK HOUSE
AGAIN HE HUFFED AND PUFFED AND BLEW THE HOUSE DOWN SENDING THE TWO PIGS RUNNING TO THEIR BROTHER'S BRICK HOUSE
AT THE BRICK HOUSE THE WOLF TRIED AGAIN BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD HE HUFFED AND PUFFED HE COULDNâ€™T BLOW IT DOWN
FRUSTRATED THE WOLF TRIED TO CLIMB DOWN THE CHIMNEY BUT THE CLEVER THIRD PIG HAD A POT OF BOILING WATER WAITING
THE WOLF FELL IN AND RAN AWAY NEVER TO BOTHER THE PIGS AGAIN
THE THREE PIGS LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER IN THEIR STURDY BRICK HOUSE
